# ReadMe

To read or not to read?

Here lies a basic static website project using Jekyll.  For the real scoop go to the project [Wiki](https://github.com/Byrnesz/project-jekyll/wiki)

Jekyll is cool (think butthead interpretation).  I'm a noob when it comes to interwebs content, so bare with me. I'm sure, in time, I will be able to make sense out of efficient development tools.  Don't laugh to hard or use savage trolling techniques designed to instill pain and punishment.  Troll me at joemammas@outlook.com 

Thank you for you support.
