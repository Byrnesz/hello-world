To read or not to read?

Here lies a basic static website project using Jekyll.  For the real scoop go to the project Wiki here <https://github.com/Byrnesz/project-jekyll.wiki.git>  

Jekyll is cool (think butthead interpretation). I'm a noob when it comes to easy ways to serve up html content, so bare with me. I'm sure, in time, I will be able to make sense out of efficient development tools.  Until then don't laugh to hard or use savage trolling techniques designed to instill pain and punishment. Just chill...be patient..stay calm and have a super wonderful day.

Thank you for you support.
