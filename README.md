# Hello-World

Hi All!

Mike here, I like Python and Angular.js mostly because those are the only languages I know at this time.
I will leave nuggets here and there for you to explore.
What, you say are nuggets? Tune in next week for the answer and more!
BTW; I'm sure you know what Sluggets are... Nuggets are different.
